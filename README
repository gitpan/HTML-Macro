HTML::Macro is a macro preprocessor designed for generating web pages from
HTML templates augmented with a simple tagset (<if>,<else/>,<include/>,<loop>).
HTML::Macro supports variable (macro) substitution, conditional evaluation
(using perl expressions), file interpolation (like SSI), and looping for
repeated format blocks with varying data (like rows in a table).  It is
especially convenient for filling out data-driven web pages using DBI.  Its
use is not restricted to HTML; we have also used it for generating email
and other text files, but the tagging syntax is derived from HTML/XML.

Installation is totally vanilla; just unpack the distribution,
> tar xvfz HTML-Macro-1.13.tgz
> cd HTML-Macro-1.13
> perl Makefile.PL
> make install (prob. as root)
