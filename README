HTML::Macro is a macro preprocessor designed for generating web pages from
HTMLish templates augmented with a simple tagset (<if>,<else/>,<include/>,<loop>,<define>,<eval>).

HTML::Macro supports variable (macro) substitution, conditional evaluation
(using perl expressions), file interpolation (like SSI), looping for
repeated format blocks with varying data (like rows in a table), and
arbitrary evaluation of perl expressions while encouraging a natural
separation of form, code and content.

It is especially convenient for filling out data-driven web pages using
DBI.  Its use is not restricted to HTML; we have also used it for
generating email and other text files, but the tagging syntax is derived
from HTML/XML.

Installation is totally vanilla; just unpack the distribution,
> tar xvfz HTML-Macro-1.xx.tgz
> cd HTML-Macro-1.xx
> perl Makefile.PL
> make install (prob. as root)
